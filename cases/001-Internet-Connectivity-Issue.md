<h2><span class="s1"><strong>4. Initial Assessment</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p3">The incident was classified as a network connectivity issue affecting a single workstation.</p>
<p class="p3">The technician confirmed that the user could not access internet resources and began troubleshooting from the endpoint before considering escalation to the network team.</p>
<p class="p4">The investigation focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network adapter status.</li>
<li>IPv4 configuration.</li>
<li>DHCP lease and default gateway.</li>
<li>Connectivity to the local gateway.</li>
<li>External IP connectivity.</li>
<li>DNS resolution.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="s1"><strong>5. Technician Acknowledgement</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p3">The technician acknowledged the incident and informed the user that the network configuration and connectivity would be checked.</p>
<p class="p3">The user was advised that further updates would be provided after the initial diagnostic tests.</p>
<h2><span class="s1"><strong>6. Investigation and Troubleshooting</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span class="s1"><strong>Step 1 — Check Network Adapter Status</strong></span></h3>
<p class="p3">The technician opened Windows Settings and navigated to:</p>
<p class="p5"><strong>Settings → Network &amp; internet</strong></p>
<p class="p3">The network adapter was checked to confirm that the workstation was connected to the local network.</p>
<p class="p3">The technician then opened Command Prompt to perform additional diagnostic tests.</p>
<h3><span class="s1"><strong>Step 2 — Inspect IP Configuration</strong></span></h3>
<p class="p6">The following command was executed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">ipconfig /all</code></pre>
<p class="p1">The output was reviewed to identify the workstation’s IPv4 address, subnet mask, default gateway, DHCP status and DNS server configuration.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Finding:</strong> The workstation had an invalid IPv4 configuration and was not receiving a valid network configuration from DHCP.</p>
<p class="p1">This indicated that the workstation could not communicate correctly with the local network gateway.</p>
<h3><span class="s1"><strong>Step 3 — Test Connectivity to the Default Gateway</strong></span></h3>
<p class="p4">The technician identified the configured default gateway and executed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">ping &lt;gateway-ip&gt;</code></pre>
<p class="p1"><strong>Finding:</strong> The gateway was unreachable using the workstation’s existing network configuration.</p>
<p class="p1">This result supported the initial finding that the workstation had a local network configuration problem.</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Note: ICMP traffic may be blocked by some devices. A failed ping alone does not conclusively prove that a gateway is unavailable.</em></p>
<h3><span class="s1"><strong>Step 4 — Check External Connectivity</strong></span></h3>
<p class="p5">The technician attempted to reach an external IP address:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">ping 1.1.1.1</code></pre>
<p class="p1"><strong>Finding:</strong> External connectivity was unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="p1">Since the workstation could not establish connectivity to the local gateway, the external connectivity failure was consistent with the identified IP configuration issue.</p>
<h3><span class="s1"><strong>Step 5 — Test DNS Resolution</strong></span></h3>
<p class="p4">The technician executed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">nslookup example.com</code></pre>
<p class="p1"><strong>Finding:</strong> DNS resolution was unsuccessful while the workstation was experiencing the network connectivity issue.</p>
<p class="p1">The DNS test was documented alongside the gateway and external connectivity checks. Because the workstation’s underlying network configuration was invalid, DNS failure was treated as a symptom rather than an independently confirmed DNS server fault.</p>
<h2><span class="s1"><strong>7. Root Cause</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>Identified root cause:</strong> Invalid IP configuration on the Windows 11 workstation, preventing normal communication with the local network gateway.</p>
<p class="p1">The investigation indicated that the workstation did not have a valid DHCP-assigned network configuration.</p>
<p class="p1">The issue was isolated to the affected workstation. The available diagnostic findings did not establish a wider network outage.</p>
<h2><span class="s1"><strong>8. Remediation</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p1">The technician renewed the workstation’s DHCP lease to request a fresh network configuration.</p>
<p class="p4">The following commands were executed in Command Prompt:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew</code></pre>
<p class="p1">The technician then refreshed the local DNS resolver cache:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">ipconfig /flushdns</code></pre>
<p class="p1">Finally, the workstation’s new network configuration was checked:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">ipconfig /all</code></pre>
<p class="p1"><strong>Result:</strong> The workstation received a valid IP configuration, including a usable IPv4 address, subnet mask, default gateway and DNS server.</p>
<p class="p1">The corrective action restored the network configuration required for normal connectivity.</p>
<h2><span class="s1"><strong>9. Post-Remediation Validation</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p1">After applying the corrective action, the technician repeated the connectivity tests.</p>
<h3><span class="s1"><strong>Test 1 — Verify IP Configuration</strong></span></h3>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">ipconfig /all</code></pre>
<p class="p1"><strong>Result:</strong> Passed. The workstation had a valid network configuration.</p>
<h3><span class="s1"><strong>Test 2 — Test the Default Gateway</strong></span></h3>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">ping &lt;gateway-ip&gt;</code></pre>
<p class="p1"><strong>Result:</strong> Passed. The workstation could communicate with the default gateway.</p>
<h3><span class="s1"><strong>Test 3 — Test External Connectivity</strong></span></h3>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">ping 1.1.1.1</code></pre>
<p class="p1"><strong>Result:</strong> Passed. The workstation could reach the external IP address.</p>
<h3><span class="s1"><strong>Test 4 — Verify DNS Resolution</strong></span></h3>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">nslookup example.com</code></pre>
<p class="p1"><strong>Result:</strong> Passed. The DNS query successfully returned a resolution for the requested domain.</p>
<h3><span class="s1"><strong>Test 5 — Verify User Access</strong></span></h3>
<p class="p1">The technician confirmed that websites and the online services required for the user’s work were accessible again.</p>
<p class="p4"><strong>Overall validation result: PASS</strong></p>
<h2><span class="s1"><strong>10. Technician Update</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p1">The technician updated the incident with the diagnostic findings and corrective actions performed.</p>
<p class="p1">The update recorded that the workstation had an invalid IP configuration, that the DHCP lease was renewed, and that connectivity was restored after the network configuration was refreshed.</p>
<p class="p1">The successful gateway, external connectivity and DNS tests were documented as validation evidence.</p>
<h2><span class="s1"><strong>11. Official Resolution</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p4"><strong>Resolution summary:</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The internet connectivity issue was resolved by renewing the workstation’s DHCP lease and refreshing its DNS cache.</p>
<p class="p1">After the workstation obtained a valid IP configuration, connectivity to the default gateway and external IP addresses was restored. DNS resolution and access to the user’s required online services were also verified.</p>
<p class="p1">No escalation was required because the issue was resolved through standard Level 1 troubleshooting procedures.</p>
<h2><span class="s1"><strong>12. User Confirmation</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p1">The user confirmed that internet access was working again and that the online services required for daily work were accessible.</p>
<p class="p1">The user was informed that the incident had been resolved and that the ticket would be closed.</p>

<h2><span class="s1"><strong>16. How the Issue Was Resolved</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p3">The incident was caused by an invalid IP configuration on the Windows 11 workstation.</p>
<p class="p3">The technician used standard Windows network diagnostic commands to investigate the problem, identified the invalid configuration, and renewed the DHCP lease.</p>
<p class="p3">After obtaining a valid network configuration, the workstation successfully communicated with the default gateway, reached an external IP address and resolved domain names through DNS.</p>
<p class="p3">The user confirmed that internet access had been restored. The incident was documented and resolved without escalation.</p>
<h2><span class="s1"><strong>17. Technician Insight</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p3">This incident demonstrates a structured Level 1 approach to troubleshooting network connectivity problems.</p>
<p class="p3">Rather than immediately restarting the router or escalating the issue, the technician began with the affected workstation and investigated each layer of connectivity in sequence.</p>
<p class="p4">The key lessons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the endpoint’s network configuration before assuming a wider network outage.</li>
<li>Use <code>ipconfig /all</code> to inspect DHCP, IPv4, gateway and DNS settings.</li>
<li>Test local gateway connectivity before investigating external connectivity.</li>
<li>Distinguish IP connectivity problems from DNS resolution problems.</li>
<li>Use <code>ipconfig /release</code> and <code>ipconfig /renew</code> when the evidence indicates a DHCP configuration issue.</li>
<li>Repeat diagnostic tests after remediation.</li>
<li>Document findings, corrective actions and validation results in the ticket.</li>
<li>Confirm service restoration before closing the incident.</li>
</ul>
